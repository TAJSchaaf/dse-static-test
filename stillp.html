                  Last summer, I went for a run. And I do not run with any music. I run
                  musiclessly. And so I get to the gym, and I, for once, don’t have headphones while
                  I’m exercising. And I heard a song that I’ve heard, I don’t know, 2 million times,
                  probably? “This Is How We Do It” —
                  
                  <cite  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar">
                     This is how we do it.
                     </cite>
                  
                  — by Montell Jordan.
                  
                  <cite  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar">
                     This is how we do it. It’s Friday night, and I feel all
                     right. The party’s here on the West Side, so I reach for my —
                     </cite>
                  
                  And somewhere at the beginning of this song, after I have gotten all of the
                  groove establishment thoroughly in my system again, I started to hear this song in
                  a
                  completely new way. There’s this great line in this song where he’s saying, It feels so good in my hood tonight, and the summertime skirts
                  and my guys in Kani, and all the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by.
                  .He lives in south central Los
                  Angeles, which in 1995 when this song comes out is well established as a
                  particular pop culture zone, from Poetic Justice and Boyz N da Hood
                  and Menace To
                  Society, It’s a violent place where people could die at any minute. 
                  
                  And there is just something so moving about the idea that because this
                  party is happening, somebody is going to live tonight. And in its way, it is
                  celebrating life in the most subtle, and, I don’t know, at the same time mundane way.
                  And I was really picking up what Montell
                  was putting down. And the fact is that he put it down a long time ago. I was just
                  finally ready to stop dancing and pick it up. And what I heard was that it wasn’t
                  just some stellar piece of hip-hop R&amp;B. It was a country song. 
                  
                  
                  I’m Wesley Morris, and I am high on Montell Jordan because I am hearing him like I have never heard him
                  before. I’m also a culture writer at “The New York Times,” and this is “Still
                  Processing.”

                   OK. Yes, I did just say that. I do think that This Is How We Do It is a country song. And here’s what I
                  mean. There’s a kind of country song that is exclusively about where people have come
                  from — I mean where they physically actually are from. The one that came to mind for
                  me is kind of the opposite of This Is How We Do
                  It. It’s Merle Haggard’s Okie From Muskogee from <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="date">1969</span>. You know, he’s upset about people’s negative reaction to the war. So
                  he went and wrote a song about how none of those values have crept into the culture
                  of Muskogee, Oklahoma
                  
                  <cite  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar">
                     We don’t smoke marijuana in Muskogee. We don’t take our trips on

                     </cite>
                  
                  I mean, he’s already saying, like, listen, this is what’s not happening
                  here.

                  Nope, we don’t burn draft cards. We go fight in the war.

                  He has judged half the country in five bars. There are no lines to read
                  between. He’s laying it all out. And “Okie From
                  Muskogee” is the sort of songs, the sort of country song, that should be
                  familiar to any country listener. It is about celebrating the place where you’re from
                  and what its values are based on the constituency of the artist. You can go as far
                  forward as Eric Church, who is basically
                  writing songs about where he’s from that are about what you won’t be doing when you
                  get there.

                  And so this tradition of saying, hey, this is where I’m from, is also a
                  kind of way of saying, this is the kind of American person I am. And what Montell Jordan is doing, by comparison, is
                  saying, you guys from Muskogee perhaps
                  have judged us. You guys had this one idea from the  Los Angeles riots, but there’s a sliver of something else
                  to say about this place that I’m from, which is that life can be pretty good here,
                  too.

                  I listen to this song now, and I just hear such a depth and complexity that 
                  laughter
                   I could never have heard as a 19-year-old. I just couldn’t have heard it.
                  And I’m not the only person in this relationship that is thinking about the uses of
                  the past. The bass line of “This Is How We Do
                  It” is a sample from Slick Rick’s Children’s Story, which by
                  <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="date">1995</span> would have been a hip-hop classic from a previous
                  era. So in that sense, this song is the past speaking to Montell Jordan. And it’s been with me this whole time. That
                  song hadn’t changed at all. I had. I am a slightly more sophisticated person than
                  I
                  was when I was 19.

                  And I would say that the song that wins the “I haven’t changed, you have”
                  championship belt is Losing My Religion by
                  R.E.M.

                  It’s a song that I heard for the first time when I was 15 years old. It’s
                  their biggest hit. They were my favorite band because I felt like they were always
                  trying to tell me something that was encoded in the songwriting.
                  
                  <cite  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar">
                     I thought that I heard you laughing. I
                     thought that I heard you sing. I think I thought I saw you try.

                  Somewhere in there was the truth about the person singing the songs. And in
                  this case, that person’s name is Michael
                  Stipe. He is the lead singer of that band. And I think the thing for me as
                  a kid and a teenager that was so appealing to me about R.E.M. was the possibility
                  that Michael Stipe might actually be
                  singing about 
                  sigh
                   being gay. Losing My Religion was
                  a song that seemed to be most explicitly about a kind of love or attraction that I
                  was very familiar with at 15 years old, which was, you like somebody and they don’t
                  like you back. They don’t even know you exist. And there’s so much shame and
                  embarrassment, but also determination to be heard and seen and to speak. I would
                  listen to this song over and over. I would transcribe the lyrics in my little
                  notebook that I kept. And even when I was an adult, I still thought my fascination
                  for, my love of this song, was about Michael
                  Stipe. And it wasn’t until about a year ago, when I heard the band on an
                  episode of a show called “Song Exploder” — I was waiting for Michael Stipe to be like, yes, I wrote this song, and it’s
                  definitely about this guy. I don’t know, his name is Nick, and Nick never returned
                  any of my feelings. But I actually was listening to Michael Stipe, and I realized, wait a minute, Wesley. You’ve
                  had this wrong the whole time. This amazing song, this beautiful, lyrical song, was
                  actually just telling you that you — Wesley — were gay. I was writing the lyrics out
                  looking for answers to who I was, not who he was. And you know, I’m an adult now
                  who’s ready to do my own work. I don’t need the art to do it for me. But it’s nice
                  to
                  know that I always had a guardian angel in the form of this band and this song.
                  
                  When I’m at the gym or watching a TV show like “Song Exploder,” and I hear
                  an old song in a new way, whatever it is, whatever you call that experience — I think
                  some version of that happened to us collectively last year when that “Framing Britney Spears” documentary came out.
                  
                  For a lot of people, this was the first time they were hearing anything
                  about how she didn’t have any control over her life.
                  
                  And she couldn’t make her own decisions about her career, or how to spend
                  her money, or her medical care or even how to be a mother. And I was in this
                  documentary for a little bit, and what really struck me about it — one of the things
                  — was just how her fans essentially became her protectors, her town criers, spreading
                  the word about her situation.
                  
                  But there is something about all of this sort of justice-oriented energy
                  being directed at this one very famous white woman, when there’s a whole other
                  universe of injustice happening for people — and I’m not saying that the people who
                  were working to free Britney Spears, for
                  instance, aren’t interested in criminal justice reform or closing the wealth gap.
                  But
                  even if getting Britney Spears out of
                  that bad conservatorship is your personal cause, your fight to stop global warming,
                  we still actually might have a problem, because Britney Spears is also an artist. And one of the side effects of shedding
                  light on this issue of conservatorships, at least with respect to Britney Spears, is that I actually think it
                  kind of changes our relationship to her work. And one thing that I can imagine
                  happening, because we now have devoted so much time and energy and concern and care
                  and worry to the well-being of this person who makes music that used to thrill us,
                  is
                  that it now becomes sad music. 
                  laughter
                   It doesn’t make us happy anymore. When we hear — when we hear those opening
                  bars of Baby One More Time,like dun, dun, dun, dun-
                  
                  <cite  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar">
                     
                     opening bars of "...Baby One More Time"
                     
                     </cite>
                  
                  And we feel so attached to the sad aspect of what we just went through with
                  Britney Spears that when it comes on,
                  we’re going to put our lighters up like it’s Candle in the Wind or Purple Rain. And
                  instead of running to the dance floor or staying on the dance floor and, you know,
                  dancing our brains out and grinding up against somebody, it’s going to be like —
                  
                  <cite  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar">
                     Hit me baby one more time.
                     </cite>
                  
                  She didn’t die, y’all. She’s here. Y’all freed her. She’s free. But I also
                  think this isn’t just about Britney
                  Spears. We’ve spent the last five years in what we have been calling the
                  Me Too Movement. Since the revelations
                  around Harvey
                  Weinstein and a bunch of other hideous people, we’ve actually come to
                  understand how deep and old this system is. And some of that reckoning has to do with
                  how the entertainment industry has perpetuated and excused the mistreatment of so
                  many women. But I don’t want that to culminate in the amputation of the pleasure that
                  these people once brought us. That’s what we’ve been talking about for the last five
                  years, in so many ways. What do we do with all of these bad people who made this good
                  art that we liked? Or what do we do with these wronged people who brought us all this
                  pleasure over the years? There was no way to live with the products that came out
                  of
                  this lechery, abuse, exploitation. And I don’t know if that’s really quite right,
                  because I really don’t think that the question is, like, artist or art? I mean, it’s
                  artist and art. I mean, I, the other day, was in downtown Brooklyn, walking on Fulton
                  Street, and somebody was outside playing Jam by Michael Jackson. And I heard it, and I had to stop. And I
                  really had to think about what to do. Because my body went back to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="date">1991</span>, and Jam was a jam. I just — I love that song. But I was thinking, as I’m
                  standing there being transported — like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
                  Just <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="date">three years ago</span>, when we were in the midst of
                  re-reckoning our relationship with Michael
                  Jackson, I definitely would have been like, nope, can’t listen, don’t want
                  to hear it, got to keep walking. Don’t go back to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="date">'91</span>, don’t
                  go back to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="date">'91</span>. But here in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="date">2022</span>,
                  three years later, on the one hand, I am very aware of what Michael Jackson is alleged to have done to many children
                  during his time on this Earth. And on the other hand, I can allow myself the private
                  experience of letting this song transport me back to a place I used to be. I can
                  think about those kids, and I can think about when I was a kid and I loved that song.
                  I mean, one of the beautiful things about art is that the art itself is not going
                  to
                  change. “This Is How We Do It" is the same song in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="date">1995</span> as it is in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="date">2022</span>. Same song. It’s
                  always going to feel like an invitation to me — like, come, see how we do it. And
                  that invitation is always going to feel spiritual. And one of the great things about
                  art is no matter what the circumstances are of the artist who made the work, the art
                  itself is always going to be there, essentially unchanged, ready for you, waiting
                  for
                  you to be ready to receive it.

                  That’s our show. And I can’t believe this, but I have a special guest in
                  the studio with me today. It’s Christopher Tompkins, my nephew. Say hi,
                  Christopher.
                  
                  Hi. So I’m new here. And this is a pretty big deal for me because I’ve
                  actually never done this before. But yeah, I’m ready to do this.
                  
                  You’re ready to do it? OK. So we’re going to read the credits. So why don’t
                  you start? 
                  
                  All right. “Still Processing” is produced by Elyssa Dudley and Hans
                  Buetow.
                  
                  It’s edited by Sara Sarasohn and Sasha Weiss.
                  
                  The show was mixed by Marion Lozano and recorded by Maddy Masiello.
                  
                  Digital production by Mahima Chablani and Des Ibekwe.
                  
                  Our theme music is by Kindness. It’s called “World Restart” from the album
                  “Otherness.”
                  
                  Ah, we’ll be back next week. Christopher, that was amazing. Thanks for
                  doing this with me. I love you.
                  
                  No problem. I love you, too. So goodbye. Goodbye, guys. That was fun.
                  Goodbye.

                  Did you see everything, by the way?
                  
                  Yeah, I got — I used an elevator, and then I didn’t have a key card, so I
                  got trapped in a bunch of rooms, glass rooms. And a nice lady helped me out. And I
                  was like, I wanted to go in the elevator again. And then it happened again. So then
                  the security guard had to let me out. And I did it a third time.
                  
                  Yeah, OK. You were on floors that you shouldn’t have been on.
                  
                  Yeah, and then I got stuck. And a bunch of people had to help me out. And
                  it was pretty stressful.
                  
                  Well, you’re here now. That’s all that matters.
