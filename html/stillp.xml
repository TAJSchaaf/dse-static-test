   <text>
      <body>

         <div type="intro">

            <p>Last summer, I went for a run. And I do not run with any music. I run
               musiclessly. And so I get to the gym, and I, for once, don’t have headphones while
               I’m exercising. And I heard a song that I’ve heard, I don’t know, 2 million times,
               probably? “<name type="song" ref="#songThis">This Is How We Do It</name>” —</p>

            <cit type="songclip">
               <quote source="#songThis">This is how we do it.</quote>
            </cit>

            <p>— by <name type="musician" ref="#musicMJ1">Montell Jordan</name>.</p>

            <cit type="songclip">
               <quote source="#songThis">This is how we do it. It’s Friday night, and I feel all
                  right. The party’s here on the West Side, so I reach for my —</quote>
            </cit>

            <p>And somewhere at the beginning of this song, after I have gotten all of the
               groove establishment thoroughly in my system again, I started to hear this song in a
               completely new way. There’s this great line in this song where he’s saying, <quote
                  source="#songThis">It feels so good in my hood tonight, and the summertime skirts
                  and my guys in Kani, and all the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by.
               </quote>He lives in South Central <name type="place" ref="#placeLA">Los
                  Angeles</name>, which in 1995 when this song comes out is well established as a
               particular pop culture zone, from <name type="album"
                  ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q3496674">Poetic Justice</name> and <name
                  type="album" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4035350">Boyz N da Hood</name>
               and <name type="album" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1173003">Menace To
                  Society</name>, It’s a violent place where people could die at any minute. </p>

            <p>And there is just something so moving about the idea that because this
               party is happening, somebody is going to live tonight. And in its way, it is
               celebrating life in the most subtle, and, I don’t know, at the same time mundane way.
               And I was really picking up what <name type="musician" ref="#musicMJ1">Montell</name>
               was putting down. And the fact is that he put it down a long time ago. I was just
               finally ready to stop dancing and pick it up. And what I heard was that it wasn’t
               just some stellar piece of hip-hop R&amp;B. It was a country song. </p>


            <p>I’m Wesley Morris, and I am high on <name type="musician" ref="#musicMJ1"
                  >Montell Jordan</name> because I am hearing him like I have never heard him
               before. I’m also a culture writer at “The New York Times,” and this is “Still
               Processing.” </p>
         </div>

         <div type="body">
            <p> OK. Yes, I did just say that. I do think that <name type="song"
                  ref="#songThis">This Is How We Do It</name> is a country song. And here’s what I
               mean. There’s a kind of country song that is exclusively about where people have come
               from — I mean where they physically actually are from. The one that came to mind for
               me is kind of the opposite of <name type="song" ref="#songThis">This Is How We Do
                  It</name>. It’s <name type="musician" ref="#musicMH">Merle Haggard</name>’s <name
                  type="song" ref="#songOkie">Okie From Muskogee</name> from <date when="1969"
                  >1969</date>. You know, he’s upset about people’s negative reaction to the war. So
               he went and wrote a song about how none of those values have crept into the culture
               of <name type="place" ref="#placeMuskogee">Muskogee, Oklahoma</name></p>

            <cit type="songclip">
               <quote source="songOkie" type="lyrical">We don’t smoke marijuana in <name
                     type="place" ref="#placeMuskogee">Muskogee</name>. We don’t take our trips on
                  L.S.D.</quote>
            </cit>

            <p>I mean, he’s already saying, like, listen, this is what’s not happening
               here.</p>

            <cit type="songclip">
               <quote source="#songOkie" type="lyrical">—cards down on Main Street.</quote>
            </cit>

            <p>Nope, we don’t burn draft cards. We go fight in the war.</p>

            <cit type="songclip">
               <quote source="#songOkie" type="lyrical">—we like living right and being
                  free.</quote>
            </cit>

            <p>He has judged half the country in five bars. There are no lines to read
               between. He’s laying it all out. And “<name type="song" ref="#songOkie">Okie From
                  Muskogee</name>” is the sort of songs, the sort of country song, that should be
               familiar to any country listener. It is about celebrating the place where you’re from
               and what its values are based on the constituency of the artist. You can go as far
               forward as <name type="musician" ref="#musicEC">Eric Church</name>, who is basically
               writing songs about where he’s from that are about what you won’t be doing when you
               get there.</p>

            <cit type="songclip">
               <quote source="#songGive" type="lyrical">Give me back my hometown, ‘cause this is my
                  hometown.</quote>
            </cit>

            <p>And so this tradition of saying, hey, this is where I’m from, is also a
               kind of way of saying, this is the kind of American person I am. And what <name
                  type="musician" ref="#musicMJ1">Montell Jordan</name> is doing, by comparison, is
               saying, you guys from <name type="place" ref="#placeMuskogee">Muskogee</name> perhaps
               have judged us. You guys had this one idea from the <name type="event"
                  ref="#eventLA92"> Los Angeles riots</name>, but there’s a sliver of something else
               to say about this place that I’m from, which is that life can be pretty good here,
               too.</p>

            <cit type="songclip">
               <quote source="#songThis" type="lyrical"><name type="place" ref="#placeLA">South
                     Central</name> does it like nobody does. (This is how we do it.) Oh, it’s party
                  time. (This is how we do it.) Straight up coming from the West Side. (This is how
                  we do it.)</quote>
            </cit>

            <p>I listen to this song now, and I just hear such a depth and complexity that <vocal>
                  <desc>laughter</desc>
               </vocal> I could never have heard as a 19-year-old. I just couldn’t have heard it.
               And I’m not the only person in this relationship that is thinking about the uses of
               the past. The bass line of “<name type="song" ref="#songThis">This Is How We Do
                  It</name>” is a sample from <name type="musician"
                  ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q708620">Slick Rick</name>’s <name type="song"
                  ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5098228">Children’s Story</name>, which by
                  <date when="1995">1995</date> would have been a hip-hop classic from a previous
               era. So in that sense, this song is the past speaking to <name type="musician"
                  ref="#musicMJ1">Montell Jordan</name>. And it’s been with me this whole time. That
               song hadn’t changed at all. I had. I am a slightly more sophisticated person than I
               was when I was 19.</p>

               </quote>
            </cit>

            <p>And I would say that the song that wins the “I haven’t changed, you have”
               championship belt is <name type="song" ref="#songLosing">Losing My Religion</name> by

            <p>Somewhere in there was the truth about the person singing the songs. And in
               this case, that person’s name is <name type="musician" ref="#musicMS">Michael
                  Stipe</name>. He is the lead singer of that band. And I think the thing for me as
               a kid and a teenager that was so appealing to me about R.E.M. was the possibility
               that <name type="musician" ref="#musicMS">Michael Stipe</name> might actually be
               singing about <vocal>
                  <desc>sigh</desc>
               </vocal> being gay. <name type="song" ref="#songLosing">Losing My Religion</name> was
               a song that seemed to be most explicitly about a kind of love or attraction that I
               was very familiar with at 15 years old, which was, you like somebody and they don’t
               like you back. They don’t even know you exist. And there’s so much shame and
               embarrassment, but also determination to be heard and seen and to speak. I would
               listen to this song over and over. I would transcribe the lyrics in my little
               notebook that I kept. And even when I was an adult, I still thought my fascination
               for, my love of this song, was about <name type="musician" ref="#musicMS">Michael
                  Stipe</name>. And it wasn’t until about a year ago, when I heard the band on an
               episode of a show called “Song Exploder” — I was waiting for <name type="musician"
                  ref="#musicMS">Michael Stipe</name> to be like, yes, I wrote this song, and it’s
               definitely about this guy. I don’t know, his name is Nick, and Nick never returned
               any of my feelings. But I actually was listening to <name type="musician"
                  ref="#musicMS">Michael Stipe</name>, and I realized, wait a minute, Wesley. You’ve
               had this wrong the whole time. This amazing song, this beautiful, lyrical song, was
               actually just telling you that you — Wesley — were gay. I was writing the lyrics out
               looking for answers to who I was, not who he was. And you know, I’m an adult now
               who’s ready to do my own work. I don’t need the art to do it for me. But it’s nice to
               know that I always had a guardian angel in the form of this band and this song.</p>

            <p>When I’m at the gym or watching a TV show like “Song Exploder,” and I hear
               an old song in a new way, whatever it is, whatever you call that experience — I think
               some version of that happened to us collectively last year when that “Framing <name
                  type="musician" ref="#musicBS">Britney Spears</name>” documentary came out.</p>

            <p>For a lot of people, this was the first time they were hearing anything
               about how she didn’t have any control over her life.</p>

            <p>And she couldn’t make her own decisions about her career, or how to spend
               her money, or her medical care or even how to be a mother. And I was in this
               documentary for a little bit, and what really struck me about it — one of the things
               — was just how her fans essentially became her protectors, her town criers, spreading
               the word about her situation.</p>

            <p>But there is something about all of this sort of justice-oriented energy
               being directed at this one very famous white woman, when there’s a whole other
               universe of injustice happening for people — and I’m not saying that the people who
               were working to free <name type="musician" ref="#musicBS">Britney Spears</name>, for
               instance, aren’t interested in criminal justice reform or closing the wealth gap. But
               even if getting <name type="musician" ref="#musicBS">Britney Spears</name> out of
               that bad conservatorship is your personal cause, your fight to stop global warming,
               we still actually might have a problem, because <name type="musician" ref="#musicBS"
                  >Britney Spears</name> is also an artist. And one of the side effects of shedding
               light on this issue of conservatorships, at least with respect to <name
                  type="musician" ref="#musicBS">Britney Spears</name>, is that I actually think it
               kind of changes our relationship to her work. And one thing that I can imagine
               happening, because we now have devoted so much time and energy and concern and care
               and worry to the well-being of this person who makes music that used to thrill us, is
               that it now becomes sad music. <vocal>
                  <desc>laughter</desc>
               </vocal> It doesn’t make us happy anymore. When we hear — when we hear those opening
               bars of <name type="song" ref="#songBaby">Baby One More Time</name>,like <shift
                  new="singing"/>dun, dun, dun, dun-</p>

            <cit type="songclip">
               <quote source="#songBaby" type="acoustic">
                  <desc>opening bars of "...Baby One More Time"</desc>
               </quote>
            </cit>

            <p>And we feel so attached to the sad aspect of what we just went through with
                  <name type="musician" ref="#musicBS">Britney Spears</name> that when it comes on,
               we’re going to put our lighters up like it’s <name type="song"
                  ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q56071967">Candle in the Wind</name> or <name
                  type="song" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2000445">Purple Rain</name>. And
               instead of running to the dance floor or staying on the dance floor and, you know,
               dancing our brains out and grinding up against somebody, it’s going to be like —</p>

            </cit>

            <p>She didn’t die, y’all. She’s here. Y’all freed her. She’s free. But I also
               think this isn’t just about <name type="musician" ref="#musicBS">Britney
                  Spears</name>. We’ve spent the last five years in what we have been calling the
                  <name type="event" ref="#eventMeToo">Me Too Movement</name>. Since the revelations
               around <name type="person" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q531599">Harvey
                  Weinstein</name> and a bunch of other hideous people, we’ve actually come to
               understand how deep and old this system is. And some of that reckoning has to do with
               how the entertainment industry has perpetuated and excused the mistreatment of so
               many women. But I don’t want that to culminate in the amputation of the pleasure that
               these people once brought us. That’s what we’ve been talking about for the last five
               years, in so many ways. What do we do with all of these bad people who made this good
               art that we liked? Or what do we do with these wronged people who brought us all this
               pleasure over the years? There was no way to live with the products that came out of
               this lechery, abuse, exploitation. And I don’t know if that’s really quite right,
               because I really don’t think that the question is, like, artist or art? I mean, it’s
               artist and art. I mean, I, the other day, was in downtown Brooklyn, walking on Fulton
               Street, and somebody was outside playing <name type="song"
                  ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q262596">Jam</name> by <name type="musician"
                  ref="#musicMJ2">Michael Jackson</name>. And I heard it, and I had to stop. And I
               really had to think about what to do. Because my body went back to <date when="1991"
                  >1991</date>, and <name type="song" ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q262596"
                  >Jam</name> was a jam. I just — I love that song. But I was thinking, as I’m
               standing there being transported — like, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
               Just <date when="2019">three years ago</date>, when we were in the midst of
               re-reckoning our relationship with <name type="musician" ref="#musicMJ2">Michael
                  Jackson</name>, I definitely would have been like, nope, can’t listen, don’t want
               to hear it, got to keep walking. Don’t go back to <date when="1991">'91</date>, don’t
               go back to <date when="1991">'91</date>. But here in <date when="2022">2022</date>,
               three years later, on the one hand, I am very aware of what <name type="musician"
                  ref="#musicMJ2">Michael Jackson</name> is alleged to have done to many children
               during his time on this Earth. And on the other hand, I can allow myself the private
               experience of letting this song transport me back to a place I used to be. I can
               think about those kids, and I can think about when I was a kid and I loved that song.
               I mean, one of the beautiful things about art is that the art itself is not going to
               change. “<name ref="#songThis">This Is How We Do It</name>" is the same song in <date
                  when="1995">1995</date> as it is in <date when="2022">2022</date>. Same song. It’s
               always going to feel like an invitation to me — like, come, see how we do it. And
               that invitation is always going to feel spiritual. And one of the great things about
               art is no matter what the circumstances are of the artist who made the work, the art
               itself is always going to be there, essentially unchanged, ready for you, waiting for
               you to be ready to receive it.</p>

            <p>That’s our show. And I can’t believe this, but I have a special guest in
               the studio with me today. It’s Christopher Tompkins, my nephew. Say hi,
               Christopher.</p>

            <p>Hi. So I’m new here. And this is a pretty big deal for me because I’ve
               actually never done this before. But yeah, I’m ready to do this.</p>

            <p>You’re ready to do it? OK. So we’re going to read the credits. So why don’t
               you start? </p>

            <p>All right. “Still Processing” is produced by Elyssa Dudley and Hans
               Buetow.</p>

            <p>It’s edited by Sara Sarasohn and Sasha Weiss.</p>

            <p>The show was mixed by Marion Lozano and recorded by Maddy Masiello.</p>

            <p>Our theme music is by Kindness. It’s called “World Restart” from the album

            <p>Ah, we’ll be back next week. Christopher, that was amazing. Thanks for
               doing this with me. I love you.</p>

            <p>No problem. I love you, too. So goodbye. Goodbye, guys. That was fun.

            <p>Did you see everything, by the way?</p>

            <p>Yeah, I got — I used an elevator, and then I didn’t have a key card, so I
               got trapped in a bunch of rooms, glass rooms. And a nice lady helped me out. And I
               was like, I wanted to go in the elevator again. And then it happened again. So then
               the security guard had to let me out. And I did it a third time.</p>

            <p>Yeah, OK. You were on floors that you shouldn’t have been on.</p>

            <p>Yeah, and then I got stuck. And a bunch of people had to help me out. And
               it was pretty stressful.</p>
