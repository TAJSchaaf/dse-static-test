            <p style="text-aling: center">"The true Jew</p>
            <p>Our Newspaper is made for the Jewish people as a whole, for everything who finds 
               interest in important articles about all matters concerning our brothers
               in the whole world; in every issue we want to give detailed reports about
               all polictical occurances and want to deliver all important news as well as those that belong
               to all Jewish matter, as well as general world news. Therefore, every Jew will find in our
               paper a short but detailed list about everything important and intereseting and
               does not have to make great effort to read Polish or German newspapers, which the gen-
               eral public does not completely understand.
            </p>
            <p>However, we want to care that not only the public class reads it. We want 
               for our paper to be particularly special for our pious brothers, which have not left behind
               the true Jewry, which are the religion and our Jewish teaching  and also see to teach their children
               the truth. Our pious, honest brothers have not had a single Jewish paper until today,
               what should be written according to his opinion, his view and his
               thoughts, about all the matters, that are concerning Jewish people as a whole, writing and reporting
               in a way, which does not harm our ultra-orthodox brothers. This paper
               is written in ordinary Jewish language, which everyone should understand, which hasn’t existed yet and this should be our newspaper.
