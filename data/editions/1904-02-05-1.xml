               Our Newspaper is made for the Jewish people as a whole, for everything who finds 
               <lb/>interest in important articles about all matters concerning our brothers
               <lb/>in the whole world; in every issue we want to give detailed reports about
               <lb/>all polictical occurances and want to deliver all important news as well as those that belong
               <lb/>to all Jewish matter, as well as general world news. Therefore, every Jew will find in our

               <lb/>does not have to make great effort to read Polish or German newspapers, which the gen-
               <lb/>eral public does not completely understand.

               <lb/>the true Jewry, which are the religion and our Jewish teaching  and also see to teach their children
               <lb/>the truth. Our pious, honest brothers have not had a single Jewish paper until today,
               <lb/>what should be written according to his opinion, his view and his
               <lb/>thoughts, about all the matters, that are concerning Jewish people as a whole, writing and reporting
               <lb/>in a way, which does not harm our ultra-orthodox brothers. This paper
               <lb/>is written in ordinary Jewish language, which everyone should understand, which hasn’t existed yet and this should be our newspaper.
